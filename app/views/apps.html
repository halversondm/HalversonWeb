<h2>Discount Calculator</h2>

<p>I originally wrote this as a Sencha Touch app. However, I lost
  the code and I can't seem to recover it from the 'compiled' code that
  Sencha helps you to put together. Anyway, I wrote it for Courtney in
  2013 because she was working at an outlet store that offered this
  style of discounts.</p>
